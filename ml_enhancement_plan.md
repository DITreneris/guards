## Business Objectives

1. **Increase lead conversion rates** by 30% through intelligent lead scoring and personalization
2. **Improve lead quality** by identifying high-value prospects early in the funnel
3. **Enhance user experience** through dynamic content personalization
4. **Optimize resource allocation** by focusing sales efforts on high-potential leads
5. **Provide actionable insights** to marketing and sales teams via ML-driven dashboards

## Technical Approach

Our approach employs a layered ML strategy that starts with foundational analytics and progressively adds more sophisticated ML features while maintaining the existing application's performance and reliability.

The implementation will follow these principles:
- **Data privacy by design** - Ensuring GDPR and CCPA compliance
