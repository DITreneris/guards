### Recommendations for Ongoing Performance Monitoring

1. Implement Real User Monitoring (RUM) to gather field data
2. Set up automated Lighthouse testing in CI/CD pipeline
3. Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
4. Perform quarterly performance audits to maintain scores
5. Measure performance impact before adding new features

The optimizations demonstrate that significant performance improvements can be achieved through targeted interventions, resulting in a faster, more accessible, and user-friendly website.
