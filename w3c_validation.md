## Implementation of Best Practices

In addition to fixing validation errors, several HTML5 and CSS3 best practices were implemented:

### HTML Best Practices

1. **Semantic HTML**
   - Used appropriate semantic elements (`nav`, `section`, `article`, `header`, `footer`)
   - Added ARIA attributes for improved accessibility
   - Implemented proper heading hierarchy

2. **Responsive Images**
   - Used `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for responsive images
   - Added `width` and `height` attributes to prevent layout shifts
   - Implemented `<picture>` element for art direction

3. **Form Improvements**
   - Added proper labels for all form elements
   - Implemented appropriate input types (email, tel, etc.)
   - Added validation attributes (required, pattern, etc.)

4. **Performance Attributes**
   - Added `loading="lazy"` for images below the fold
   - Used `preload` for critical resources
   - Implemented `defer` for non-critical scripts

### CSS Best Practices

1. **Modern Layout Techniques**
   - Implemented CSS Grid and Flexbox with fallbacks
   - Used `clamp()` for responsive typography
   - Implemented CSS Custom Properties for theme colors

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Used mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
   - Implemented media queries for breakpoints
   - Avoided fixed dimensions where possible

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Used CSS contains hints
   - Minimized the use of expensive properties
   - Implemented will-change for animations

4. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Ensured sufficient color contrast
   - Added focus styles for keyboard navigation
   - Implemented reduced motion queries
