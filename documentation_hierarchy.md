This document outlines the organization and structure of documentation for the Guards & Robbers project to ensure consistency, accessibility, and maintainability of project knowledge.

## Documentation Structure

```
/
├── index.md                     # Central documentation portal
├── README.md                    # Project overview and getting started
├── dev_plan.md                  # Development plan and project strategy
├── todo.md                      # Prioritized tasks and implementation status
├── documentation_hierarchy.md   # This file - documentation organization
├── implementation_summary.md    # Overview of implemented features
├── mongodb_setup_guide.md       # MongoDB Atlas setup instructions
└── security_documentation.md    # Security implementation details
```

## Documentation Levels

The project documentation is organized in a hierarchical structure with different levels of detail:

1. **Level 1: Entry Points** - High-level documentation that provides an overview of the project
   - index.md
   - README.md

2. **Level 2: Planning & Strategy** - Documentation related to project planning and management
   - dev_plan.md
   - todo.md
   - documentation_hierarchy.md

3. **Level 3: Implementation Details** - Documentation describing implemented features and systems
   - implementation_summary.md
   - mongodb_setup_guide.md
   - security_documentation.md

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming

- All documentation files should use lowercase with underscores
- All documentation files should have the .md extension
- Names should be descriptive and concise

### Document Structure

Each document should follow this general structure:

1. **Title** - Clear, descriptive title at the top (H1)
2. **Version and Date** - Current version and last updated date
3. **Purpose Statement** - Brief description of the document's purpose
4. **Table of Contents** - For documents longer than 100 lines
5. **Main Content** - Organized with clear headings (H2, H3, etc.)
6. **Related Documents** - Links to related documentation

### Formatting Guidelines

- Use Markdown formatting consistently
- Use headings (H1, H2, H3) to organize content hierarchically
- Use bulleted or numbered lists for series of items
- Use code blocks with language specification for code examples
- Use tables for structured data
- Use bold for emphasis and italic for secondary emphasis

### Links and References

- All documents should link to related documents
- Links should use relative paths within the repository
- External links should include the full URL and a description

## Maintenance Responsibilities

All team members are responsible for:

1. **Keeping documentation up-to-date** - Update relevant documentation when making code changes
2. **Following the established structure** - Maintain the hierarchy and formatting standards
3. **Improving documentation** - Identify gaps and suggest improvements
4. **Cross-referencing** - Ensure proper links between related documents

## Documentation Review Process

New and significantly updated documentation should undergo review:

1. **Self-review** - Check for clarity, completeness, and consistency
2. **Peer review** - Have another team member review for accuracy and usefulness
3. **Integration** - Update the index.md file with references to new documentation

## Using This Document

When creating or updating documentation:

1. Refer to this document for guidance on structure and standards
2. Update the index.md file if creating new documentation
3. Add appropriate cross-references to related documents
4. Include version and last updated date at the top

By maintaining a consistent documentation hierarchy, we ensure that project knowledge remains accessible and useful throughout the project lifecycle.
