        self.intent_classifier = IntentClassifier()
        self.entity_extractor = EntityExtractor()
        self.sentiment_analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()
        self.context_manager = ContextManager()

    def process_message(self, message: str, context: Dict) -> Dict:
        intent = self.intent_classifier.predict(message)
        entities = self.entity_extractor.extract(message)
        sentiment = self.sentiment_analyzer.analyze(message)
        context = self.context_manager.update(context, message)
        
        return {
            "intent": intent,
            "entities": entities,
            "sentiment": sentiment,
            "context": context
        }
```

### Response Generation

```python
class ResponseGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.template_engine = TemplateEngine()
        self.content_generator = ContentGenerator()
        self.quality_checker = QualityChecker()

    def generate_response(self, 
                         intent: str, 
                         entities: Dict, 
                         context: Dict) -> str:
        # First try template-based response
        response = self.template_engine.get_response(intent, entities)
        
        # If no template matches, generate dynamic response
        if not response:
            response = self.content_generator.generate(intent, entities, context)
        
        # Quality check the response
        if self.quality_checker.validate(response):
            return response
        else:
            return self.template_engine.get_fallback_response()
```

### Integration System

```python
class IntegrationManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.email_client = EmailClient()
        self.crm_client = CRMClient()
        self.support_system = SupportSystem()
        self.analytics = AnalyticsSystem()

    def handle_incoming_message(self, message: Dict) -> None:
        # Process the message through NLP
        processed = self.nlp_engine.process_message(message)
        
        # Generate response
        response = self.response_generator.generate_response(
            processed["intent"],
            processed["entities"],
            processed["context"]
        )
        
        # Send response through appropriate channel
        if message["channel"] == "email":
            self.email_client.send_response(message["to"], response)
        elif message["channel"] == "chat":
            self.chat_client.send_response(message["chat_id"], response)
        
        # Update CRM and analytics
