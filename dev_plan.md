   - `feature/*`: Feature branches
   - `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
   - `release/*`: Release preparation branches
   - `hotfix/*`: Production emergency fixes

2. **Commit Standards**:
   - Conventional commit messages: `type(scope): description`
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Example: `feat(form): add validation for email field`

3. **Pull Request Process**:

   - PR title follows conventional commit format
   - Required sections: Description, Screenshots, Testing steps

4. **Versioning Scheme**:
   - Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - Automated version bumping based on commit types
   - Release tags for each production deployment

5. **Code Freeze Periods**:
   - 24 hours before scheduled releases
   - QA testing prioritized during code freeze
