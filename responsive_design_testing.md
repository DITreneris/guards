|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Mobile | Low-res images (< 600px width) | Reduced page weight by 68% |
| Tablet | Medium-res images (< 1200px width) | Reduced page weight by 42% |
| Desktop | High-res images | Full quality for desktop experience |
| Large Desktop | High-res images with art direction | Optimized for large displays |

**Implementation**: Used HTML5 `<picture>` element with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes to deliver appropriate images for each viewport size.

## Conclusion

The Guards & Robbers marketing website meets all responsive design requirements across the defined breakpoints. The mobile-first approach has resulted in a fluid experience that adapts appropriately to different device sizes while maintaining functionality and visual integrity.

One minor issue was identified and resolved in the tablet view. The website is approved for deployment from a responsive design perspective.

### Recommendations

1. Continue testing on real devices periodically
2. Consider implementing an automated visual regression testing system
3. Monitor analytics for unusual device types and optimize as needed

The responsive implementation balances performance and aesthetics well, with specific optimizations for each breakpoint.
