## Additional Insights

Based on our latest tests with model quantization and performance optimizations, we observed:

1. **Model-Specific Quantization Results**
   - **Email categorization model**: 16.5% size reduction with 8-bit quantization
   - **Intent recognition model**: No size reduction (-0.35%), indicating the model architecture may not be suitable for this quantization approach
   - **Sentiment analysis model**: No size reduction (-2.4%), suggesting further refinement of quantization techniques needed

2. **Performance Optimization Effectiveness**

   - Monitoring sampling rate set to 10% greatly reduced overhead while maintaining visibility
   - Memory and disk optimizations applied successfully with garbage collection scheduling

3. **Model Monitoring**
   - Monitoring alerts for model health correctly identified low accuracy issues
   - Latency metrics successfully tracked (avg: 52.22ms, p95: 150ms)
   - System shows accurate throughput metrics (~9 predictions/minute in testing environment)

4. **Challenges Identified**
   - Not all model architectures benefit equally from quantization
   - Sklearn models showed variable quantization results based on internal structure
   - Ground truth recording needs further improvement to match predictions with inputs

These findings inform our roadmap for further optimization work, particularly in developing model-specific quantization techniques and enhancing the monitoring system's prediction tracking capabilities.
